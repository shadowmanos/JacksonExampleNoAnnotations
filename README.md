# non-annotated-jackson-example
[http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome](Jackson) is an efficient and simple to use Java library for data-binding of JSON documents and POJOs. When I first used Jackson following various examples, I was slightly annoyed by having to annotate stuff or having to manually create a no-args constructor just for Jackson's sake. These issues also came up when using Lombok with my POJOs. This is an example of how to use Jackson without annotations and without introducing an unnecessary no-args constructor.
